# Real-Time GPS Data Acquisition for DJI Drone Pilots

This project is a receiver for DJI’s Drone-ID protocol, designed specifically for drones operating on OcuSync 2.0. Its primary goal is to demonstrate that real-time personal data — including the GPS location of both the drone and its operator — can be accessed.

## Reference Material

One key resource that has been especially useful for this project is a github project's research paper detailing a signal processing chain for DJI's Drone ID protocol. This project not only provides a thorough explanation of the underlying theory and methodology but also includes the associated source code, which has been invaluable for understanding and implementing the system.

The research paper along with the original code for hacking DJI drone can be found at [Drone-ID Receiver for DJI OcuSync 2.0](https://github.com/RUB-SysSec/DroneSecurity).
